# Sparkify Data Lake: ETL with Spark

This project creates a ETL pipeline written in Python using PySpark library. It aims to ingest two different datasets from S3, logs and songs, creating five analytics tables in a star schema using Spark dataframes, and load them back into S3 as parquet files. 

Firtly, the ETL pulls data from an S3 bucket and loads it to staging tables on Redshift, then, it create the dataframes as analytics tables and lastly, it write everything as parquet files into another S3 bucket.

## Datasets

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`

`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, `TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`, looks like.

```javascript
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json`

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like (just the first 5 rows).

```

## Database

The tables were designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. 

To achieve that, everything from logs and songs json files was loaded into two different dataframes, without any transformation.

After that, the data was transformed into the following schema using Spark dataframes:

#### Fact Table
 1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
 2. **users** - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
 3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
 4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
 5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*


### Prerequisites

The solution was built using Python 3.6.3 and PySpark 2.4.3. For the complete package list used to build and run this application, please refer to the file [requirements-env.txt](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-datalake/blob/main/requirements.txt). The complete environment packages was also exported using `conda` into the file [environment.yaml](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-datalake/blob/main/environment.yaml). 


### How to run

1. Update the file [dl.cfg](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/dl.cfg) with your AWS credentials.

2. Create an S3 bucket to be used as the parquet files destination and update the file [dl.cfg](https://github.com/alexfmonteiro/sparkify-redshift/blob/main/dl.cfg) with the S3 bucket path.

3. Then, run the application via CLI:

```
python etl.py
```


Alternatively:
1. Run the application using only local sample files with the following CLI command:

```
python etl.py sample
```

2. The sample logs and songs files in the `data` folder will be ingested and processed, and the parquet result files will be stored also locally, in the folder specified as SAMPLE_OUTPUT_DATA variable (inside dl.cfg file), `data/output/` by default.
